This is the README file for the submission of Assignment 3 from John
Phillips, B00685175.

The program consists of 2 Python files (assign3.py and assign3_functions.py)
and can be compiled and run from the command:

    python assign3.py

in the console from the folder it is contained in. Once running, the program
will prompt the user for the inputs:

    What is the name of the file containing your data?
    Please enter the minimum support rate (0.00-1.00):
    Please enter the minimum confidence rate (0.00-1.00):

The association rules for the specified parameters will be saved in the text
file called Rules.txt.

Please note that the data file must be in the same folder as the program. I
have included the 3 demo data files in my submission to make it easier for you.

The program will refuse inputs for the minimum support and confidence rates that
fall outside of the range [0, 1].
